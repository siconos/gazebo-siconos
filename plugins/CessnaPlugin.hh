  /// The plugin requires the following parameters:
  /// <propeller>         Name of the joint controlling the propeller spin.
  /// <propeller_max_rpm> Maximum angular speed in rpm.
  /// <left_aileron>      Name of the joint controlling the left aileron.

  /// <right_aileron>     Name of the joint controlling the right aileron.
  /// <right_flap>        Name of the joint controlling the right flap.
  /// <elevators>         Name of the joint controlling the rear elevators.
  /// <rudder>            Name of the joint controlling the rudder.
  ///
  /// The following parameters are optional:
  /// <propeller_p_gain> P gain for the PID that controls the propeller's speed.
  /// <propeller_i_gain> I gain for the PID that controls the propeller's speed.
  /// <propeller_d_gain> D gain for the PID that controls the propeller's speed.
  /// <surfaces_p_gain> P gain for the PID that controls the position of the
  ///                   control surfaces.

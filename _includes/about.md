# About

This site documents the repository Gazebo-Siconos repository, a fork
of the upstream [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) repository on
bitbucket, extended to feature an experimental physics back-end
powered by Siconos.

[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) is a simulation interface for
robotics, featuring integration with ROS, and supports multiple
physics back-ends.  The upstream repository can be found
at [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/), with an active
pull request for the project
open [here](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2628).

See here to find more information
on [Siconos](http://siconos.gforge.inria.fr), the non-smooth dynamical
systems simulation framework for C++ and Python.
